CNC surfacing of 3D model - medium
==================================

*2.5D CNC processing of small parts. Requires build envelop of 610mm x 300mm x 55mm (xyz)*

2.5D CNC processing can include pocketing, outer profiling, drilling, and 2.5D surfacing operations.  Medium parts generally require work-holding other than vacuum so fixturing the parts is a consideration and parts will need to be smaller than the maximum size to allow for the vise, clamp, or other holding mechanism.  An example of a machine capable of cnc_25D_medium: ShopBot Buddy
