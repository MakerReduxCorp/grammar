Surface preparation using sand paper or other abrasive
======================================================

*Surface preparation to produce a smooth uniform surface.  Assumes that edge integrity is maintained.  Uniformity and acceptability of surface may depend on wood species.*

Sanding can be more complex than expected.  Good sanding is always done with the dominant grain and produces a surface ready for finishing.  Achieving the desired surface may require multiple grades of abrasive and considerable time.  When sanding two surfaces perpendicular to each other, the corner should remain intact.  Dust and other sanding by-products should be removed.
