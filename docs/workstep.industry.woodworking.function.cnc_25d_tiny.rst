CNC surfacing of 3D model - small
=================================

*2.5D CNC processing of small parts. Requires build envelop of 300mm x 200mm x 55mm (xyz)*

2.5D CNC processing can include pocketing, outer profiling, drilling, and 2.5D surfacing operations.  Small parts generally require work-holding other than vacuum so fixturing the parts is a consideration and parts will need to be smaller than the maximum size  (approx 25mm per side) to allow for the vise, clamp, or other holding mechanism.  An example of a machine capable of cnc_25D_small would be Inventables Carvey or ShopBot Desktop
