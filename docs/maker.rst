A 'maker' is a specific role played by a manufacturer. One or more parts and/or worksteps are assigned to each maker. At time of production, this role is usually played by a single real-world person or company. It is possible for a single manufacturer to fulfill multiple maker roles, however. But the opposite is not true: a maker role cannot be split up. All of the worksteps and parts assigned to a single maker role are expected to be fulfilled by one maker.
