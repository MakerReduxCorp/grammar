Maker Redux: Grammar Documentation
===============================================

Maker Redux is a supply chain management software for distributed manufacturers.  It focuses on the 'Third Way' of manufacturing  - A Hybrid that is neither hand-made nor mass-produced but includes features and advantages of both.

Talk to a woodworker and you'll hear words like 'kerf', 'grain', 'figure'.  You might know that paper has 'weight' but a printer might distinguish between 'printing weight' and 'writing weight'.  These terms have special meaning to insiders in an industry and sometimes the same word will mean very different things in different industries.  These specialized terms and their meanings are the grammar of each industry. 

At the core of the Maker Redux system is a workflow system that routes units of work to each manufacturer at just the right time.  To do this, a robust language is needed to describe the work in terms each manufacturer can understand.  These pages document the existing grammars that Maker Redux uses. You can use this grammar to create worksteps in your recipes with a high degree of confidence that the manufacturer can understand what you mean.  
Industry techniques are changing all the time so the grammars described here will never be complete but the language they are written in will allow you to extend the grammar as needed.
